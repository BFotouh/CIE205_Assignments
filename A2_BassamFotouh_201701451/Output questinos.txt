the smallest number of lines/tellers pairs is: 3
we could get that result by two ways:
1- to run the simulation and try different pairs number till we obtain average below 10
2- by calculations as following:
the percentage that a new customer arrives at each tick is 60% that means after the 100 ticks we will have
around 60 customers. The maximum serving time is 15 which means that on average each customer will take around
7.5 ticks to be served. So, if we have only one line in the first tick it will take 7.5 ticks to serve him.
During those ticks we would have around 4 to 5 new customers.
* if they were in one line: the first will take 7.5 ticks to be served, the second 15, and so on till the the fifth
will take around 37.5 ticks... which average to around 22.5 ticks
* if they were in two lines: the 5 new customers will be divided into 2 and 3; (decreasing the nomenator)
the first customer of both lines will take around 7.5 ticks and the second 15 and the third 22.5 ticks
which averages to 15 ticks in the longest line.
* if they were in 3 lines: there will be two lines having 2 customers and 1 having 1; waiting ticks as 7.5 for the first
15 for the second customer in each line... which averages between 7.5 and 11.25 ticks and around 8 to 9 ticks for any new customer
